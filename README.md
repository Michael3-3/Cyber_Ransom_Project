# Intelligent Ransomware Prevention & Detection System

## Project Overview

This project is a **cybersecurity system** designed to **detect and prevent ransomware attacks** in real-time. It continuously monitors system activity, identifies suspicious behavior, and isolates potential threats to protect critical data and ensure business continuity.

## Features

* **Real-time File Monitoring:** Tracks file behavior for unauthorized access or encryption.
* **Ransomware Detection:** Detects suspicious activities before files are encrypted.
* **Prevention Mechanism:** Automatically isolates malicious processes.
* **Data Protection:** Safeguards important files and prevents loss.
* **Early Threat Alerts:** Notifies users immediately when a threat is detected.

## Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python, Java, C
* **Libraries & Tools:** System monitoring tools, Encryption libraries, Logging modules
* **Concepts Applied:** Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking (VAPT), TCP/IP, Networking
* **Database (if applicable):** N/A (or specify if used)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## How It Works

1. Monitors file system activities in real-time.
2. Detects abnormal behaviors indicative of ransomware.
3. Triggers alerts and isolates suspicious processes.
4. Logs events for analysis and auditing.
5. Ensures recovery by safeguarding uninfected files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

* Start the system and let it run in the background.
* When ransomware-like activity is detected, it will alert you and take preventive actions automatically.
* Check the logs for details on all monitored activities.

## Learning Outcomes

* Understanding real-time system monitoring for security threats.
* Implementing ransomware detection and prevention mechanisms.
* Practical experience with file encryption behaviors and cybersecurity protocols.
* Applying ethical hacking and threat analysis concepts.

## Future Enhancements

* Integrate with cloud storage for extended protection.
* Add AI-based anomaly detection for smarter ransomware prevention.
* Develop a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring and alerts.
